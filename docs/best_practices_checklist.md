- [x] Implement fallback values for environment variables to handle missing configurations.
- [x] Use type hints and validation for environment variables to catch configuration errors early.

## pyyaml
- [x] Use `safe_load()` instead of `load()` to prevent arbitrary code execution.
- [x] Implement schema validation for YAML files to ensure data integrity.
- [x] Use YAML anchors and aliases for DRY configuration.

## torch
- [x] Use GPU acceleration whenever possible for improved performance.
- [x] Implement proper model checkpointing for long-running training sessions.
- [x] Utilize PyTorch's built-in data loaders for efficient data handling (N/A - using API-based models instead of local training).
- [x] Regularly profile your code to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.

## torchaudio
- [x] Use torchaudio's transforms for efficient audio preprocessing (N/A - using alternative audio processing methods).
