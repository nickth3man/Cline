# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

- To automate the process of downloading, organizing, transcribing, and summarizing YouTube videos for efficient research, review, and content analysis.
- To provide a user-friendly, maintainable workflow that keeps all assets for each video together for easy access and future use.
- To overcome the limitations of standard STT models and produce highly accurate, well-formatted transcripts suitable for publication, leveraging the flexibility and control of open-source tools combined with powerful LLMs accessed via a unified API (OpenRouter).

## Problems It Solves

- Eliminates manual steps in collecting and organizing video, audio, and text assets from YouTube playlists.
- Ensures that all relevant files (videos in all resolutions, audio, transcript, summary) are grouped in a single, predictable location.
- Reduces friction for downstream analysis, sharing, or further processing.
- Addresses inaccuracies in raw STT output, especially for proper nouns and technical terms.
- Improves punctuation, spelling, and formatting in raw transcripts.
- Provides speaker identification in basic STT.
- Reduces time-consuming manual correction required to achieve publication quality.
- Mitigates limitations and costs associated with closed-box commercial transcription solutions.

## How It Should Work

- The user provides a YouTube playlist URL.
- The system downloads every available video resolution for each video, saving them in a folder named after the video title.
- The system extracts the audio, transcribes it, and generates a summary, all saved in the same folder.
- The user can easily find all assets for a given video in one place, with consistent naming and structure.
- The transcription process includes:
  1. **Input:** Audio/video file + Optional reference document (e.g., script) containing key terms/nouns.
  2. **Transcription:** Generate initial transcript using the OpenRouter API key for external AI calls.
  3. **Term Extraction:** If a reference document is provided, extract key terms/nouns using an LLM via OpenRouter.
  4. **Correction:** Use LLM via OpenRouter to produce a corrected transcript with improved accuracy, punctuation, and grammar.
  5. **Diarization:** Process audio with `pyannote.audio` to get speaker timestamps.
  6. **Speaker Mapping (Optional):** Use LLM via OpenRouter to assign actual names to speaker labels based on context/reference document.
  7. **Combine & Format:** Merge the corrected text with speaker labels and timestamps, formatting into desired output (Markdown, HTML, etc.).
  8. **Output:** Final, high-quality, formatted transcript file(s).

## User Experience Goals

- All files for a video are grouped together, making navigation and management simple.
- The structure is robust to batch processing and future scaling.
- The workflow is extensible, allowing for new features (e.g., metadata, diarization) to be added without disrupting the core organization.
- The process is transparent, with clear logging, error reporting, and per-video error logs for easy troubleshooting.
- **Data Management:** Users can easily view the status of all processed videos, retry failed items, and manage database entries via both the GUI and CLI.
