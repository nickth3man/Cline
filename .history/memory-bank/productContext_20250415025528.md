# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

- To automate the process of downloading, transcribing, correcting, summarizing, and diarizing YouTube videos and playlists for research, accessibility, and content analysis.
- To provide a user-friendly, maintainable workflow that keeps all assets for each video together for easy access and future use.
- To offer transparency and control over AI model selection and cost, while ensuring high-quality results.

## Problems It Solves

- Eliminates manual steps in collecting and organizing video, audio, and text assets from YouTube playlists.
- Ensures all relevant files (audio, transcript, summary, diarization, metadata) are grouped in a single, predictable location.
- Provides high-accuracy transcription (Whisper), robust sentence splitting (SpaCy), and user-selectable LLMs for correction and summarization, with live price feedback.
- Always includes speaker diarization using pyannote.audio for advanced content analysis.
- Reduces friction for downstream analysis, sharing, or further processing.
- Improves transparency and control over AI costs and model selection.

## How It Should Work

- The user provides a YouTube playlist URL.
- The system downloads audio for each video, saving it in a per-video folder.
- Transcription is performed using `openai/whisper-large-v3` via OpenRouter.
- Sentence splitting and cleanup is performed using SpaCy.
- The user selects any available OpenRouter LLM for correction and summarization, with live price estimates shown in the UI.
- Diarization is always performed using pyannote.audio locally.
- All outputs (audio, raw transcript, corrected transcript, summary, metadata, diarization, HTML reader) are saved in the videoâ€™s folder.
- The user can review, print, or further process the results as needed.

## User Experience Goals

- All files for a video are grouped together, making navigation and management simple.
- The structure is robust to batch processing and future scaling.
- The workflow is extensible, allowing for new features (e.g., additional metadata, export formats) to be added without disrupting the core organization.
- The process is transparent, with clear logging, error reporting, and per-video error logs for easy troubleshooting.
- **Model Selection and Cost Transparency:** Users can select any OpenRouter LLM for correction and summarization, with real-time price feedback based on transcript size and model choice.
- **Diarization is always included** for advanced analysis and downstream applications.
