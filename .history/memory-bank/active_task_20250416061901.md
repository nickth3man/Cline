## Diagnose and Resolve Python Environment Issue - RESOLVED

**Objective:** Identify and fix the root cause of the incorrect Python interpreter (`C:\Users\nicki\Documents\Cline\MCP\browser-use\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`) being used when running project scripts, which prevents modules like `yt-dlp` from being found.

**Background:**
- Enhanced logging confirmed the wrong interpreter is being used despite attempts to run scripts from the correct project directory.
- This issue was preventing the successful execution of the YouTube processing pipeline.

**Actions Taken:**
- Added detailed environment logging to multiple scripts (`download_and_process.py`, `workflow_logic.py`, `enforce_project_structure.py`, `verify_output_structure.py`).
- Logs clearly showed the incorrect interpreter path and environment variables (`PATH`, `VIRTUAL_ENV`, `sys.path`).
- Created a diagnostic script (`fix_python_environment.py`) to help identify the Python environment issues.
- Created wrapper batch files (`run_pipeline.bat` and `verify_structure.bat`) that explicitly use the correct Python interpreter.
- Implemented a Python wrapper script (`python_wrapper.py`) to properly handle module imports.
- Fixed circular imports in the codebase (particularly in `transcription_workflow.py`).
- Implemented the missing `get_system_info()` function in `workflow_logic.py`.
- Corrected module import structure in `run_full_pipeline.py`.
- Installed missing dependencies (`psutil`).

**Resolution:**
- The Python environment issue has been successfully resolved. The scripts now run with the correct Python interpreter from the project's virtual environment (`C:\Users\nicki\Documents\Cline\venv\Scripts\python.exe`).
- The pipeline script now successfully locates and imports all required modules, including `yt-dlp`.
- Testing confirmed that the issue is fixed, with the scripts now progressing past all import-related errors.

**Next Tasks:**
1. Update memory bank files (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to document the solution, including the recent pipeline run and download issues.
2. Investigate and fix playlist URL handling and video extraction logic to resolve download failures.
3. Continue improving the pipeline functionality and error handling.
4. Consider adding a more comprehensive dependency check to alert users of any missing packages early in the execution process.
