# Progress

## Current Status

- **Feature-Complete:** All core workflow features are implemented and stable:
  - Downloading videos and extracting audio (yt-dlp, ffmpeg).
  - Transcription (OpenRouter Whisper).
  - Speaker diarization (pyannote.audio, optional).
  - Transcript correction (LLM via OpenRouter).
  - Summarization (LLM via OpenRouter).
  - Centralized SQLite database for all metadata, file paths, transcripts, summaries, and processing status.
  - Robust error handling and per-video logging.
  - **Database Management:** CLI and GUI support status viewing, error listing, retry, delete (with optional file deletion), and detailed inspection of video records.
  - **Export Feature:** Users can export video metadata, transcripts, and summaries from the database to CSV or JSON Lines format via both CLI and GUI. Export logic is streaming/chunked for large datasets.
- **Security:** All API keys and tokens are managed via `.env` files; no secrets are hardcoded.
- **Documentation:** Setup, usage, and configuration are well-documented in the README and memory bank.

## Remaining Tasks

- **Documentation Review (In Progress):** Finalize and verify all memory bank files to ensure they accurately reflect the current, feature-complete state of the project.
- **Validation:** Confirm that the workflow is robust, user-friendly, and meets all requirements for future scaling and maintainability.
- **Minor Refinements:** Address any minor usability or documentation issues discovered during review.

## Known Issues

- **Diarization Dependency:** Speaker diarization requires `pyannote.audio` dependencies and a Hugging Face token (`HF_TOKEN`). If not set up, diarization will be skipped.
- **ffmpeg Dependency:** ffmpeg must be installed and available in the system PATH; errors will occur if missing.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Effectiveness of specific LLMs via OpenRouter for correction and summarization may require further prompt refinement.
- **Overlapping Speakers:** pyannote may have limitations with overlapping speakers; this may require manual correction or advanced post-processing.
- **Large Playlists:** Processing large playlists or long videos may require significant disk space and processing time.

## Evolution of Decisions

- Project scope defined based on user requirements and memory bank documentation.
- Centralized database and per-video folder structure adopted for robustness and maintainability.
- Export and management features added to support downstream analysis and data management.
- All features are now accessible via both CLI and GUI, with a focus on extensibility and user experience.
