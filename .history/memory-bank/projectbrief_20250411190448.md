# Project Brief

## Core Requirements and Goals

- Automate the process of downloading, organizing, transcribing, and summarizing YouTube videos from playlists.
- For each video, download all available resolutions and save them in a folder named after the video title.
- Extract audio, transcribe it, and generate a summary, all saved in the same folder as the video files.
- Ensure all assets for a video (videos, audio, transcript, summary) are grouped together for easy access and future use.
- Use robust, maintainable, and extensible patterns to support future enhancements (e.g., metadata, diarization, UI, improved error handling).

## Source of Truth for Project Scope

- The workflow must be fully automated and require minimal manual intervention.
- File and folder naming must be consistent, predictable, and robust to batch operations.
- The system should be easy to extend with new processing steps or integrations, and should provide clear error reporting and handling.
- Documentation (memory bank) must be kept up to date to ensure continuity after resets.

## Out of Scope

- Manual download or organization of files.
- Scattered outputs or inconsistent naming.
- Features not explicitly requested or documented in the memory bank.
